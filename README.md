[2/26/2018] I'm archiving this project as I no longer play League and it's too much work to try to keep up with the changes; be it in game or api releated.

# ggriot
ggriot is a library that is easy to use and lets you connect to Riot's API.

# Caching
This is a pretty basic library but it does make caching call's extreamly easy. ggriot uses redis, and is super easy to setup.
